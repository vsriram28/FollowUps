# FollowUps
A simple app to take notes and add follw up tasks.

# Why another Notes app?
There are plenty of Notes taking apps in the market from a simplest ones to the most sophisticated.
Many of them provide the ability to have follow up tasks created as a separate list.
But when the user checks the follow-up tasks, there is no context to any of the tasks iin the tool.
The user has to jiggle their memory on why a particular task was added and what they are supposed to do.
If the user is someone who attends multiple meetings in a day and creates follow-up tasks, then having the ability to know the context for each of the tasks will be very helpful. 
This app provides the context to each of the task.

# How to get the context for a follow-up task
When the user creates a follow-up task, it gets added to the list of already created tasks.
Selecting a task in that list, takes the user to the day and the meeting when the task was created.
Having the day, and the exact meeting provides the needed context for the user to proceed with the task.
User doesn't have to spend cycles trying to recollect the context.
